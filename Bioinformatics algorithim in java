Bioinformatics involves the application of computational techniques and algorithms to analyze biological data.
Java can be used to implement various bioinformatics algorithms for tasks such as sequence alignment, motif finding, phylogenetic analysis, and more. 
Here's an example of a simple bioinformatics algorithm in Java: sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.

```java
public class SequenceAlignment {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String sequence1 = "AGTACGCA";
        String sequence2 = "TATGC";

        int matchScore = 1;
        int mismatchScore = -1;
        int gapScore = -2;

        int[][] dp = calculateAlignmentMatrix(sequence1, sequence2, matchScore, mismatchScore, gapScore);
        String alignedSeq1, alignedSeq2;
        int[] endCoords = backtrackAlignment(dp, sequence1, sequence2);
        alignedSeq1 = sequence1.substring(endCoords[0]);
        alignedSeq2 = sequence2.substring(endCoords[1]);

        System.out.println("Aligned Sequence 1: " + alignedSeq1);
        System.out.println("Aligned Sequence 2: " + alignedSeq2);
    }

    public static int[][] calculateAlignmentMatrix(String seq1, String seq2, int match, int mismatch, int gap) {
        int[][] dp = new int[seq1.length() + 1][seq2.length() + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i <= seq1.length(); i++) {
            dp[i][0] = i * gap;
        }

        for (int j = 0; j <= seq2.length(); j++) {
            dp[0][j] = j * gap;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= seq1.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= seq2.length(); j++) {
                int matchMismatchScore = (seq1.charAt(i - 1) == seq2.charAt(j - 1)) ? match : mismatch;
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(Math.max(
                        dp[i - 1][j - 1] + matchMismatchScore,
                        dp[i - 1][j] + gap),
                        dp[i][j - 1] + gap);
            }
        }

        return dp;
    }

    public static int[] backtrackAlignment(int[][] dp, String seq1, String seq2) {
        int i = dp.length - 1;
        int j = dp[0].length - 1;

        while (i > 0 && j > 0) {
            if (i > 0 && dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j] - 2) {
                i--;
            } else if (j > 0 && dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1] - 2) {
                j--;
            } else {
                i--;
                j--;
            }
        }

        return new int[]{i, j};
    }
}
```

In this example, we implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment. 
This algorithm finds the best alignment of two sequences based on match, mismatch, and gap scores.
The `calculateAlignmentMatrix` method computes the alignment matrix, and the `backtrackAlignment` method traces back to find the aligned sequences.
Please note that bioinformatics is a highly specialized field, and more complex algorithms are used for practical applications. There are dedicated libraries like BioJava and Biopython that provide comprehensive tools for bioinformatics analysis.
